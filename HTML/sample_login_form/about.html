        Ethical hackers are paid good money to try to break into computer systems. It is often said that, to excel at their jobs, these cybercrime-fighters must “think like a black-hat hacker” — that they must understand a black-hat hacker’s strategies, motivations and modus operandi in order to block intruders from illegally infiltrating networks and systems to engage in criminal activity.

Generally speaking and depending on the needs of their employers, ethical hackers are engaged in such activities as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments and a range of strategies intended to keep their organizations safe from cyberattacks of all kinds.
